## [2.13.0] - 2026-01-20
### Changed
- **Hero Section Geometric Grid Expansion (MAJOR):** Expanded geometric grid from 6x2 to 8x2 (16 tiles total), added far-left and far-right columns, updated container widths across all viewports (Desktop: 1200px → 1600px, Tablet: 900px → 1200px, Mobile: 600px → 800px), fixed dimension locks for both .geometric-background and .geo-grid with matching constraints

## [2.12.8] - 2026-01-16
### Fixed
- **Mobile Team Member Typography:** Reduced font sizes for improved mobile viewport (375px) text density - `.member-name` reduced from 12px to 10px (line 1283), `.member-title` reduced from 10px to 8px (line 1291) - team member cards now display more compact typography appropriate for mobile devices

## [2.12.7] - 2026-01-16
### Fixed
- **Mobile Footer Layout:** Fixed SCENIC logo overlapping footer geometric grid on mobile viewport (375px) by adding `padding-top: 8rem` to `.footer-content` (line 1334) to position content below 100px geo-grid, and removing `order: -1` from `.footer-logo` (line 1340) that was causing incorrect stacking order - footer now displays proper vertical hierarchy with logo appearing below geometric pattern

## [2.12.6] - 2026-01-16
### Fixed
- **Footer Geometric Grid Comprehensive Fix (All Viewports):** Three critical fixes for consistent footer geometric grid display across Desktop, Tablet, and Mobile:
  1. **Z-Index Stacking Fix:** Added `position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; z-index: 1;` to `.footer-geo-grid` (lines 1116-1119) - SCENIC logo was overlapping geometric pattern on Tablet/Mobile, now properly layered below the grid
  2. **SVG Vertical Centering Fix:** Fixed Lottie's `preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid meet"` centering issue by adding `object-position: top;` to `.footer-geo-image` (line 1133) and `object-fit: none; object-position: top left;` to `.footer-geo-image svg` (lines 1137-1140) - eliminated ~20-30px gap at top of geometric pattern
  3. **Grid Height Consistency Fix:** Matched grid heights to design system across all viewports - Mobile: 200px → 100px (lines 1319-1321, 1326-1327), Tablet: 200px → 150px (lines 1822-1824, 1829-1830), Desktop: 200px (unchanged) - footer now displays consistent visual hierarchy
- **Overall Impact:** Footer geometric grid now starts immediately at top edge with proper z-index layering, no gaps or overlaps, consistent heights across all viewports matching design system

## [2.12.5] - 2026-01-15
### Fixed
- **Footer Geometric Grid Z-Index Stacking (Tablet + Mobile):** Added `position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; z-index: 1;` to `.footer-geo-grid` (lines 1116-1119) - SCENIC logo was floating on top of geometric pattern, now properly layered below the grid for correct visual hierarchy
- **Footer Geometric Grid Height (Tablet):** Reduced `.footer-geo-grid` height and max-height from `300px` to `200px` in tablet media query (lines 1823-1824) - this was the ROOT CAUSE of the large blue gap, tablet grid is now 200px tall like desktop for visual consistency
- **Overall Impact:** Footer now displays consistently across Desktop, Tablet, and Mobile - geometric pattern starts immediately at top of footer with proper z-index layering, no gaps or overlaps

## [2.12.4] - 2026-01-12
### Fixed
- **Footer Geometric Grid Positioning:** Removed `position: relative` override on mobile that pushed grid into document flow, added explicit `top: 0` on tablet to ensure top-edge positioning - grid now uses `position: absolute; top: 0` consistently across all viewports (Desktop, Tablet, Mobile)

## [2.12.3] - 2026-01-12
### Fixed
- **Service Cards Mobile Centering (USER SPOTTED):** Added CSS rule to center last service card when alone on row using `:last-child:nth-child(odd)` with `margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;` - now matches team member centering behavior
- **Services Section Mobile Padding:** Increased top/bottom padding from 0px to 32px for better breathing room
- **Team Section Mobile Padding:** Increased all-sides padding from 20px to 32px to reduce cramped appearance
- **Portfolio Section Padding:** Increased top/bottom padding from 16px to 32px across all viewports for better visual hierarchy
- **Overall Impact:** Improved mobile visual consistency with proper centering and uniform spacing

## [2.12.2] - 2026-01-12
### Fixed
- **Service Cards Mobile Layout:** Changed from vertical stack to 2-column grid layout (2 cards per row) using calc(50% - 0.5rem) width with flex-wrap
- **Team Member Arc Typography:** Increased arc height 60px → 70px (16.7% increase), adjusted line-height 1 → 1.2 for better text breathing room
- **Footer Logo Position:** Moved SCENIC logo above geometric grid pattern (order: -1) to eliminate visual overlap and improve hierarchy

## [2.12.1] - 2026-01-12
### Fixed
- **Service Cards Mobile Layout:** Restructured to full viewport width vertical stack with 1.5rem gap (eliminated overlap and hit box collisions)

- **Service Card Icons:** Increased size 108px → 140px for better visibility
- **Team Member Cards Mobile Layout:** Reduced card width 180px → 120px to fit 2-3 across, changed to row layout with 1rem gap
- **Team Member Typography:** Increased name size 10px → 12px (font-weight: 700), title size 8px → 10px (font-weight: 500)
